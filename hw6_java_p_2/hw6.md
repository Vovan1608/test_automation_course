Task 1

These tasks are based on the basic methods of the String class. To solve them, you can choose 4 points. Demonstrate the correctness of the created methods.

1. Write a method that takes two strings and returns true if they are equal, and false otherwise. Consider the possibility of case-sensitive and case-insensitive comparison.

2. Implement a method that takes a string and two indices, and returns the substring that is contained between those indices.

3. Create a method that checks whether a certain substring is contained in a given string, and returns the index of its first occurrence.

4. Write a method that replaces all occurrences of one substring with another in a given string.

5. Implement a method that determines whether a string contains digits, and returns true or false accordingly.

6. Write a method that removes all leading and trailing spaces from a string.

7. Create a method that splits a string into an array of substrings according to a given delimiter.
