Task 1 (String, Regular Expressions)

Input two String variables. Verify if the first variable is a substring of the second variable. For
instance, if you entered &quot;SoftServe&quot; and &quot;SoftServe Academy&quot;, the expected result should be true.

Input the last name, first name, and middle name as String variables on the console. The
following outputs will be displayed on the console:
Last name and initials
First name
First name, middle name, and last name.

The task requires validation of usernames using regular expressions. The username should be
between 3 to 15 characters and can contain only Latin alphabet, numbers, and underscores. To
accomplish this, input five different usernames in the main method and output a message to the
console indicating whether each of the entered names is valid or not.
